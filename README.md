<b>Hackathon 2021<BR>
PROBLEM STATEMENT:ALUMNI PROTAL</b>
<br>
<BR><b>Purpose:</b><br>
This system can be used as a web application for the Alumni Portal to manage the college
information and student‚Äôs information. The system is an online web application that can be
accessed throughout the organization and outside students as well with proper login provided,
which will give better service to the students.
<br>
<b>Proposed system:</b><br>
The proposed system will be online so it can be accessed by alumni anywhere. It will enable
quick and easy communication. Each user will be responsible for the updating their own
information. Each user will also have the option to maintain their privacy. It does not require the
constant attention of a group of students for its maintenance. Alumni will be able to organize
meetings and find out about job opportunities on themselves using this system.
